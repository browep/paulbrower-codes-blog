I like exploring blockchain development, Android development, Java, Kotlin and too many others to list.  I can usually be found in Boulder, CO.  More Android focused writing can be found at [http://responsiveandroid.com/](http://responsiveandroid.com/).  Public code can be found at [https://github.com/browep](https://github.com/browep). Feel free to email me at [brower.paul@gmail.com](mailto:brower.paul@gmail.com) if you have a comment question.
